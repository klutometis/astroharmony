* Test suite.

* Benchmark ecliptics agains ecliptics-alt (with true-anomaly).

* Standardize on radians.

* Compile and benchmark.

* Necessary modulos?

* Develop a moving planet with an interval, which projects the
  target's position at the interval-end; and, keeping phi and theta
  the same, increases r by (/ r interval) ticks until it meets the
  target at the interval-end.

  That way, we can transition smoothly between planets; let
  keplerian-panner-fader take a function of t as the source: thus we
  can vary the ecliptical trajectory (or not).

  Would like to have a seamless trajectory across planets; temporally
  and spatially.

* More efficient method than continuations, maybe a record-type for
  channels or keplerian data?

* Buffer output?

* NB: super-imposition of intervals is slow! Do sequential things
  sequentially.
